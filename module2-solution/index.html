                    <p>Mercedes is a 28-year-old single mother of three living in Areguá, Paraguay.

                    She is budding with dreams, but living with blindness for over ten years due to cataract made each day more difficult than the next. It was a challenge for her to find work and when she did, she faced constant discrimination and bullying due to the visible difference in her eyes. This made it very difficult to put food on the table for her young children.

                    After years of hardship and self-esteem issues, Mercedes received the Seva-sponsored cataract surgery she needed. Your generosity helped Mercedes regain her vision – on her birthday!

                    Instantly and profoundly, her life changed. She now shows up confidently as her whole self and is living a new chapter of her life with a renewed spirit of accomplishment and joy..</p>
